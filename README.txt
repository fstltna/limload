Configuration
-------------

The default configuration files are located as ``config/<name>.ini.default``.
These files are not read, and the game has these defaults set internally.
To activate a configuration file, so that you can change some
configuration fields, copy it to ``config/<name>.ini`` on Windows,
or to ``~/.config/limload/<name>.ini`` on Linux.

The ``config.ini`` file contains sections of the general game configuration.
This includes language selection, and English can be set with
``language = en_US`` in the ``[misc]`` section (if not automatically
detected as system language).

The ``input.ini`` file contains command bindings for keyboard and
other input devices.
